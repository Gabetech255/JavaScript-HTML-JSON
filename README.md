# JavaScript-HTML
This is most of the code im currently using on my home raspberry pi linux server. I built is mostly just to learn javascript 
then it kind of snowballed into html, web development and database manipulation and so on.
I made all of this so i could practice my programming skills as well as all my aquired knowledge of linux, tcp/ip, remote management(ssh,ftp), and System Administration. 

This is free to use and non-copyrighted for learning purposes.
